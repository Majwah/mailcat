NAME
    myriam.tnss -- mail delivery program that acts like cat.

USAGE
        mailcat -c config.toml [-hn] [...]

          -h Display this help message
          -c config.toml
          -n print, instead of sending the mail.

Examples
    Mail text files with attachments:

        mailcat -c config.toml mail_body.txt
        mailcat -c config.toml mail_body.txt mail_attachment_*.jpg

    Mail text from stdin pipe:

        some_program_output | mailcat -c config.toml

    Mail text from interactive stdin:

        mailcat -c config.toml
        SOME THING TO SAY
        ...
        ^D

    Mail the concatenated text from STDIN and a text file:

        mailcat -c config.toml - other_text.txt

Description
    mailcat acts like cat, but delivers to a mail destination instead of
    STDOUT.

    It requires a "-c" argument pointing to a TOML format config file with
    these key/values settings.

        [header]
        to = "smith@example.com"
        from = "alice@example.com"
        subject = "Blah blah blah, hoge hoge hoge."

        [smtp]
        host = "smtp.example.com"
        ssl = 1
        sasl_username = "alice"
        sasl_password = "alices3cretpassw0rdz"

    The "header" section is required, but the "smtp" section is optional. By
    default the program uses "sendmail".

    The stuff to be mailed at are passed with command arguments, or via
    STDIN. STDIN are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded texts. Binary files like
    images must be passed by arguments.

    mailcat takes STDIN interactively only when no arguments is passed, or
    when "-" is used in one of the arrugments. Just like "cat".

    An special environment variable "MAILCAT_OPT" can be defined to
    accomodate the need for repeatitive input of "-c config.toml" argument:

        export MAILCAT_OPT="-c /etc/mailcat.toml"

    The content of "MAILCAT_OPT" variable is prepend to the argument list in
    the beginning of the program.
